    <h2>Short History of Lasagna</h2>    
    <p>We may never know the exact person who created lasagna. In fact, this dish was not named after an individual, but after a fermented noodle called laganon that was frequently used in ancient Greece where lasagna originated. In the beginning, lasagna was sprinkled with toppings, and eaten with a pointed stick. Unrecognizable by today’s standards, the only similarity between the two was the layering of pasta and sauce.</p>
