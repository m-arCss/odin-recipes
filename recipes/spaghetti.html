    <h2>Short History of Spaghetti</h2>    
    <p>While some historians believe pasta originated in Italy, most are convinced Marco Polo actually brought it back from his epic voyage to China. The earliest known pasta was made from rice flour and was common in the east. In Italy, pasta was made from hard wheat and shaped into long strands.—bringing this ancient food much closer to modern-day spaghetti. However, the earliest Italian version was likely a bit closer to vermicelli (a pasta name that translates into English as “little worms.”). Spaghetti comes from the word Spago, which translates in English to “string,” or “twine.” In Italy, spaghetti (like all pasta) are generally cooked just to al dente (which means “to the tooth.”) to create a slightly chewy texture, rather than an overly soft consistency. Because of its shape and texture, (not too light or heavy) spaghetti can easily handle a tomato, as well as an extra virgin olive oil-based sauce. Spaghetti is frequently served with meat or vegetables, and a sauce then topped with a generous sprinkling of freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan.</p>
